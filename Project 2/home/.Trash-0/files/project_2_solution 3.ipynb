After implementing the function, run the cell to test it against the unit tests we've provided. For each problem, we provide one or more unit tests from our `project_tests` package. These unit tests won't tell you if your answer is correct, but will warn you of any major errors. Your code will be checked for the correct solution when you submit it to Udacity.\n",

    "In this project you will code and evaluate a \"breakout\" signal. It is important to understand where these steps fit in the alpha research workflow. The signal-to-noise ratio in trading signals is very low and, as such, it is very easy to fall into the trap of _overfitting_ to noise. It is therefore inadvisable to jump right into signal coding. To help mitigate overfitting, it is best to start with a general observation and hypothesis; i.e., you should be able to answer the following question _before_ you touch any data:\n",

    "> What feature of markets or investor behaviour would lead to a persistent anomaly that my signal will try to use?\n",

    "In this project, we assume that the first three steps area done (\"observe & research\", \"form hypothesis\", \"validate hypothesis\"). The hypothesis you'll be using for this project is the following:\n",
    "- In the absence of news or significant investor trading interest, stocks oscillate in a range.\n",
    "- Traders seek to capitalize on this range-bound behaviour periodically by selling/shorting at the top of the range and buying/covering at the bottom of the range. This behaviour reinforces the existence of the range.\n",
    "- When stocks break out of the range, due to, e.g., a significant news release or from market pressure from a large investor:\n",
    "    - the liquidity traders who have been providing liquidity at the bounds of the range seek to cover their positions to mitigate losses, thus magnifying the move out of the range, _and_\n",
    "    - the move out of the range attracts other investor interest; these investors, due to the behavioural bias of _herding_ (e.g., [Herd Behavior](https://www.investopedia.com/university/behavioral_finance/behavioral8.asp)) build positions which favor continuation of the trend.\n",
