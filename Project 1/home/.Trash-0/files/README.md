# Project 1: Trading with Momentum
In this project, you will learn to implement a trading strategy on your own, and test to see if it has the potential to be profitable. You will be supplied with a universe of stocks and time range. You will also be provided with a textual description of how to generate a trading signal based on a momentum indicator. You will then compute the signal for the time range given and apply it to the dataset to produce projected returns. Finally, you will perform a statistical test on the mean of the returns to conclude if there is alpha in the signal.
## Setup
[Install](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files) the required packages for your Python 3 environment using the `requirements.txt` file.
## Instructions

To complete this project, open the starter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook project1.ipynb
```

Follow the instructions in the notebook, implement each code segment marked with a `TODO`, and answer each question (**Q**) by editing the markdown cell (**A**).

**Note**: You will be asked to download market data from an online data provider, and you may have to create an account for that.


## Submit

Once you have completed your project, your final notebook should have all the code cells completed and executed without errors, showing output and any plots, as well as responses to all questions (unless marked "optional"). Submit a zip file for review containing:

- Your final notebook (`project1.ipynb`)
- An HTML export of the notebook
- Any other files you may have created (such as helper `.py` scripts) that are needed for the project

Please do not include any of the files supplied with the project or any data files (update the instructions for obtaining the appropriate data in the **Load Market Data** section of the notebook, if required).
